// Your task is to make two functions ( max and min, or maximum and minimum, etc., depending on the language ) that receive a list of integers as input, and return the largest and lowest number in that list, respectively.


const min = function(list){
    return Math.min(...list)
  }
  
const max = function(list){
    return Math.max(...list)
  }


console.log(min([-52, 56, 30, 29, -54, 0, -110]))
console.log(max([4,6,2,1,734,63,-134,566]))
